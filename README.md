# Blade
An open-source GUI for Razer peripherals meant as a replacement to the heavy Razer Synapse, which requires authentication and is a RAM-hungry application.

### How to install?

- First, grab the [Chroma SDK Core](https://assets.razerzone.com/dev_portal/downloads/Razer_Chroma_SDK_Core_v1.10.6.exe), and let it install.
- Then, either download the installer or use the portable version.

### How to use?

Download the release of Blade, start "blade.exe".

Now, you can either choose to have a full keyboard illuminated in one color, or you can choose from Modes:

Currently, only one mode is implemented: The Type Mode

This mode lights up the home row and nothing else. No distraction.

# PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
As this .NET-App utilizes Colore, a .NET wrapper over the Razer SDK. It unfortunately is poorly documented, and I am not a blessed programmer either.
So please, on a voluntary basis, help grow this project.
