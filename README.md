# Blade
An open-source GUI for Razer peripherals meant as a replacement to Razer Synapse, which requires authentication and is a RAM-hungry application.

### How to install?

- First, grab the [Chroma SDK Core](https://assets.razerzone.com/dev_portal/downloads/Razer_Chroma_SDK_Core_v1.10.6.exe), and let it install.
- Then, either download the ~installer~ or use the portable version. (Installer will eventually be readded to the project, use portable releases for now.)

### How to use?

64-bit builds ONLY!

IMPORTANT: Blade can currently only utilize keyboards, I can't test other features than for the Keyboard itself.

Download the release of Blade, start "blade.exe".

Now, you can either choose to have a full keyboard illuminated in one color, or you can choose from Modes:

## Features:
This application has the following features:

- Different modes: Typing mode, Gaming mode, Laptop Mode and Quiet Mode

- Game Mode: Minecraft, CS:GO, Among Us, Stardew Valley, Phasmophobia (more to come)
