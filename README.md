# Blade
An open-source GUI for Razer peripherals meant as a replacement to Razer Synapse, which requires authentication and is a RAM-hungry application.

### How to install?

- First, grab the [Chroma SDK Core](https://assets.razerzone.com/dev_portal/downloads/Razer_Chroma_SDK_Core_v1.10.6.exe), and let it install.
- Then, either download the ~installer~ or use the portable version. (Installer will eventually be readded to the project, use portable releases for now.)

### How to use?

64-bit builds ONLY!

IMPORTANT: Blade can currently only utilize keyboards, I can't test other features than for the Keyboard itself.

Download the release of Blade, start "blade.exe".

Now, you can either choose to have a full keyboard illuminated in one color, or you can choose from Modes:

## General Modes implemented: 
- The Type Mode

This mode lights up the home row and nothing else. No distraction.

- Gaming Mode

Lights up WASD in red color.

- (New since 0.10): Laptop Mode

This lights up all keys in a solid white color.

- (New since 0.10): Quiet Mode

... deactivates all keys.

## Game Modes:
- Minecraft:

Lights up WASD, Hotbar (1-9), Q, E.

**More games are supported soon!**

# PLEASE CONTRIBUTE!
This .NET-App utilizes Colore, a .NET wrapper over the Razer SDK. It unfortunately is poorly documented, and I am not a blessed programmer either.
So please, on a voluntary basis, help grow this project.
